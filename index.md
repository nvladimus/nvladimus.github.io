title: A random walk in science
---
This is a collection of my projects, interests, and observations described in a human-friendly way, as opposed to the dry 'objective' language of scientific papers. I am driven by curiosity from one scientific field to another, but there is always personal or scientific connection between them:
* Bacterial chemotaxis
* Computational neuroscience
* Light-sheet microscopy and brain imaging
* Adaptive optics
