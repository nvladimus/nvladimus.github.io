title: A random walk in science

# Under construction..
What is understanding of nature? How is it possible that an inherently lazy and easily distracted mammal such as myself can understand and sometimes correctly predict some natural phenomena?

Given the limitations of my own mind, I can only hope to understand some processes in a mechanistic way. That is, learn or discover simple rules, formulae and equations which predict some natural processes with enough accuracy to make me feel smart and satisfied. 

I am driven by curiosity from one scientific field to another, but there is always personal or scientific connection between them. They include:

[Bacterial chemotaxis and the first `smart microscope` (Berg, 1971)](chemotaxis)
* Computational neuroscience
* Light-sheet microscopy and brain imaging
* Adaptive optics
