# Processing of light-sheet microscopy data 
[Python code](https://github.com/nvladimus/ZebrafishFunctionalMaps_LinearRegression) for computing 3D maps of functional reponses in zebrafish brain. Uses [Thunder](https://github.com/thunder-project/thunder-regression) linear regression library to process the zebrafish brain activity pixel-wise.

[Python code](https://github.com/nvladimus/ZebrafishBrainRegistration_Zbrain_ANTs) for non-rigid registration of zebrafish brains onto a template brain.

Small [FiJi plugin](https://github.com/nvladimus/zebrascope_targets) for drift correction between two zebrafish brains. Used for improving single-cell ablation accuracy with two-photon laser.
