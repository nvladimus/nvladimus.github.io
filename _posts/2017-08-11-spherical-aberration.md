title: "Spherical aberrations "

Spherical is the most common aberration in microscopy, caused by different refraction of rays at high angles from the optical axis. It is easy to simulate the effect of sph. aberration by ray tracing using Snell's law of refraction, and find the conditions (i.e. immersion media) which minimize it. See examples in a python notebook [here](https://github.com/nvladimus/refractive_index_mismatch/blob/master/coverslip_spherical_aberration_rayTracing.ipynb).
